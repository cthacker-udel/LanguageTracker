# Language Tracker Application

> Author: Cameron Thacker (cthacker@udel.edu)

### This application aims to aid one of my personal hobbies, which is practicing programming problems. I created this application to house a tracker for those activities, along with other side applications I commonly use as well.

## Stack

- React
- Express
- Typescript

### I plan on achieving this vision by creating an application in React, which is consisting of a typescript front-end, heavily linted. Alongside an express backend, with hand-crafted authentication, and verification in place.
